# CREATE-project-management
A Self-Service Project Management Feature of the Eleventh Dimension platform designed to revolutionize how construction and building engineering projects are planned, executed, and monitored.
CREATE empowers users to digitally manage their projects with AI-driven insights, structured workflows, and real-time monitoring.
Users can create projects, input relevant details, and let the system generate an organized Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), breaking projects into milestones, tasks, resources, and cost estimations. Users update task completion and expenses as the project progresses, enabling the system to assess performance, generate reports, and provide actionable recommendations.
